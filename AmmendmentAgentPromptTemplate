Upgrading Content Control Prompt Template
```
While respecting the essence, and philosphy of the original <document or article name>, I want you to integrate the feedback from:

User 1:
```
    <user 1 feedback>
```

and

User 2:
```
    <user 1 feedback>
```

<continue for as long as you have users>

Here is the latest iteration of <document or article name> for you to update:

<insert document or article that needs updated>
```
